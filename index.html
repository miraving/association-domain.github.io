                        <p>I am a person who is motivated by technologies of different directions, but my main passion is for developing IOS applications. I have a very extensive development experience in various fields of human activity including banks, hospitals and aviation. I am also interested in security in all IT areas.
I'm married and have a super restless kid who is almost 3 years old. I spend my free time on self-development or reading books.
I will be happy to share my experience in project management and development.</p>

<p>Experience</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>2019 - 2022</em></p>

<p><strong>15Five</strong> | 12 Gallagher Lane, San Francisco, CA 94109</p>

<p><strong>Senior iOS Engineer</strong></p>

<p>The main idea of the project is to create the opportunity to fill the report as conveniently and quickly as possible.
My role in the project is a key developer. The application was created in 2014. We are using the next programming languages as Objective-C and Swift. Technologies on the project: CoreData, AFNetworking/Alamofire, OperationQueue, Rest API, and UIKit. When I got to the project, I remember that the project has a 3% of Swift code - now this figure is 78%. Step by step the team transformed the project into Swift.</p>

<p><strong>Softserve</strong> | 2D Sadova Street, Lviv, UA 79021</p>

<p><strong>Senior iOS Engineer | Tech Lead</strong></p>

<p>My best project. I started this project for the VIVINT company. I used RxSwift technologies and it was a really good idea because for 4 months the project core changed a few times and it was simple to change some functionality. The stack of technologies was RxSwift, Alamofire, Auth, SnapKit, Mapping, and a few libraries for realizing good animation.
After one month I got a new position as the Project Technical Lead. So, I had to manage the iOS team and Android. I had to check all pull requests by the team and I had a lot of discussions for functionality edge cases and UI/UX with customers.</p>

<p><strong>REMIT</strong> | 38 Djerelna Street, Lviv, UA 79000</p>

<p><strong>Senior iOS Engineer</strong></p>

<p>Lots of projects were made here. My favorite was Excurzo. It was a social network for tracking and sharing active adventures with a high focus on geo data. The stack of technologies was Alamofire, CoreData, CoreLocation, and UIKit.</p>
